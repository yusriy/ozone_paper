We included the original data downloaded from National Oceanic and Atmospheiric Administration (NOAA) from two weather stations (station IDs: WMKB and WMKP) that contains the meteorological data and also air quallity data (also with meteorological data) obtained from Alam Sekitar Malaysia Sdn Bhd (ASMA) (station IDs: CA0003, CA0009, and CA0038) in CSV (comma-separated values) format. \r\n\r\n## HYSPLIT\r\nThis repo also contains some functions copied from the 'openair' R package (Carslaw and Ropkins, 2012) that can be used to download NCAR/NCEP data to run Hysplit (a back-trajectory analysis model). Note that you need to have HYSPLIT installed before running these functions:\r\n\r\n1. getMet.R\r\n2. read.files.R\r\n3. procTraj.R  \r\n\r\n\r\n### References\r\nCarslaw, D.C. and K.
